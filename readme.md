## hiya!
i'm krystyn, aka. kit, and this is my readme file!
<br>
i dunno what to write here, so enjoy reading something probably chaotic.

## who am i?
i'm kit, and i am a sad excuse for a human being.
<br>
what else... i'm a [dyspraxic](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/developmental-coordination-disorder-dyspraxia/) 14yo student.

i once took over from my teacher in year 4 (grade 3) to teach html cause she didn't know how to.
<br>
i got gcse grade 9 in year 7 (grade 6) for computer science because i fucked around in scratch. dunno how.

## what do i do?
i program. *shocker*.
<br>
really though, i like to program in lua and/or python, and on every other occasion i make a game on [roblox](https://www.roblox.com/).

i'm not motivated most the time so half of my projects and programs get scraped and trashed.
<br>
on the off chance i do actually finish something, imo my stuff can be decent (in terms of programming quality).

## my shit
this could mean three things.

### dev tools
i use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [roblox studio](https://create.roblox.com/)
<br>
i only really use extensions (in vscode) depending on what language i'm programming in.

### pc specs
i have a [intel 12th gen i5-12400f](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134587/intel-core-i5-12400f-processor-18m-cache-up-to-4-40-ghz.html), [16gb corsair vengeance lpx 3200 ddr4](https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/p/memory/cmk16gx4m2b3200c16/vengeancea-lpx-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-dram-3200mhz-c16-memory-kit-black-cmk16gx4m2b3200c16?srsltid=AfmBOorwkt58Xi-m0Q6Aje29FEWOec6rIgex91ajAafrvGggMyrMy-Ad), [nvidia rtx 3060](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/), and a [2tb samsung 990 pro m.2 ssd](https://www.samsung.com/uk/memory-storage/nvme-ssd/990-pro-2tb-nvme-pcie-gen-4-mz-v9p2t0bw/?srsltid=AfmBOopUdLBy-NvuEkYANETjUwM_k7yw4Vq3YY5ge_2Pja8a-I9EhZtN).
<br>
it's like a hybrid between a gaming pc and a workstation.
